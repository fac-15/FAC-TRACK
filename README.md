## Technology Stack 

Express + Handlebars + PostgreSQL

Both Express and Handlebars are great technologies, and will get you a long way. Further to that, rendering on the server can give very fast initial load time, which can result in better UX than a purely client-side rendered single-page app.
This will allow you both to consolidate what you have learned in the first 8 weeks and focus on your product.
On a similar note, if you want to learn one or more technologies like d3, Leaflet, PWAs, web-sockets, Tachyons or SASS, you may want choose backend technologies you are familiar with, so you enough time to investigate unfamiliar technologies.

+ sass and maybe more
